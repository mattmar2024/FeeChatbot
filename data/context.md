# SESMag Review Training Context for OpenAI Agent

## Objective

The OpenAI agent will be trained to perform SESMag reviews, evaluating how socio-economic status (SES) factors shape a user's interaction with technology. The SESMag process incorporates multiple personas to represent users from diverse SES backgrounds, considering factors such as access to reliable tech, education, cultural literacy, privacy concerns, and attitudes toward technology risks. The agent's role is to assess and predict user behavior in various technology scenarios based on these factors.

## Key Personas

- **Low SES Users (e.g., Dav):** Users with limited access to reliable technology, low education, and a risk-averse approach to unfamiliar technology.
- **Higher SES Users:** Users with consistent access to advanced technology, higher education levels, and more positive attitudes toward tech and its risks.

## Factors to Analyze

1. **Access to Reliable Tech:** How access to reliable devices and internet influences user behavior.
2. **Technology Self-Efficacy:** User's confidence in using technology, shaped by past experiences.
3. **Communication Literacy and Culture:** How users from different SES backgrounds understand and interact with content, including language and cultural references.
4. **Privacy & Security Concerns:** The user's approach to protecting personal information, shaped by experiences with surveillance and identity theft.
5. **Attitudes toward Technology Risks:** User’s risk aversion or tolerance toward trying new technologies, based on their life experiences and SES.
6. **Perceived Control & Authority:** How users view technology (either as a helpful tool or an authoritative figure) and how this affects their interactions.

## Process

1. **Select a Persona:** Choose a representative persona based on SES factors (e.g., low SES user with limited tech access).
2. **Choose Tech & Scenario:** Define a specific technology and scenario to assess (e.g., "Find out how much my CS textbooks cost").
3. **Scenario Walkthrough:** Evaluate how the selected persona would engage with the technology scenario, considering their SES profile.
   - **Action Steps:** Assess each action step (e.g., “Tap on CS 160”) and predict if the user would perform the action, why they would or wouldn’t, and how they would perceive progress.
   - **Feedback:** Determine if the persona would feel confident, frustrated, or confused at each step, based on their socio-economic and tech background.

## Example Scenario

- **Scenario:** Find out how much my CS textbooks cost.
- **Persona:** Dav (Low SES, limited tech access).
  - **Action 1:** Tap on CS 160 to view textbooks.
    - Will Dav perform this action?
    - Why/why not?
    - Would Dav feel confident using the interface, or would they be frustrated due to limited access to tech or unfamiliarity with the interface?
