# Fee Persona Context

SocioEconomic Mag Personas Foundations
SocioEconomic Mag currently has three personas: Dav, Ash, and Fee. This document shows the foundations behind them.

Dav and Fee are identical in several ways: They are the same age and live in the same state, and all are equally comfortable with the technology they regularly use. Their differences are strictly derived from the socioeconomic status research on five facets: their Access to Reliable Technology, Technology Self-Efficacy, Communication Literacy/Education/Culture, Attitudes toward Technology Risks/Privacy/Security, and Perceived Control and Attitude Toward Authority towards new technologies. Fee's facet values are those most frequently seen in people with high SES, Dav's facet values are those frequently seen in people with low SES and are the most different from Fee's.

Fee represents a fraction of people with backgrounds similar to theirs. For SES data on people similar to and different from Fee, see the Footnotes.

Note: All gray-background portions are fundamental to Fee. In contrast, the white-background portions can be customized to match your software's target audience.

Technology Privacy/Security: c : Fee fears losing personal information, like their identity, to new features or apps and is generally not too worried about people knowing their location. Because they tend to rely on their own device, their perception of technological features as being risky is low due to their cultural values and familiarity with technology.
